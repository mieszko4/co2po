##Description
A web application that motivates the user to use the means of transport that emits the least amount of CO2. 
It does so by presenting statistically positive outcomes, based on the calculated reduction of CO2 emission
should the user choose the suggested means of transport for his travel (for example amount of gas saved, direct
impact on the environment etc).
